# M5Unit - TUBE

## Overview

Library for UnitTUBE using [M5UnitUnified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5UnitUnified).  
M5UnitUnified is a library for unified handling of various M5 units products.

### SKU:U130
Unit Tube Pressure is a positive and negative pressure gauge that supports a wide measurement range of -100 ~ 200Kpa. When in use, it is connected via a tube, with the other end connected to the gas measurement environment. The sensor maps the range -100 ~ 200Kpa to output a voltage of 0.1 ~ 3.1V. It comes with a fully enclosed protective shell, effectively ensuring the stability of the sensor, making it very suitable for applications such as gas pressure detection in industrial equipment.
